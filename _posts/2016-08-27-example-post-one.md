The family sits among piles of UNASSEMBLED PIZZA BOXES and
folds them in silence. The crunch of cardboard is the only
sound as the cheap Pizza Time logo comes in and goes out of the
foreground.

They hear a truck rattling closer. Through the window, they
see a STREET FUMIGATION TRUCK spewing gas as it passes by. The
fog rolls closer to the window.

Ki-Woo has just walked out of the gate when he hears VIOLENT
COUGHING from inside. Itâ€™s Mun-Kwang.

He casually walks down the hill as the coughing echoes
throughout the neighborhood, creating a discordant harmony with
the MUSIC.
